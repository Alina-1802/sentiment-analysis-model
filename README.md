## ðŸ“‹ Description

This project builds a sentiment classification model using an **LSTM neural network** to recognize emotions based on raw text. The solution supports businesses in understanding user sentiment and responding more effectively.

The model was trained on a labeled dataset of emotional expressions and optimized through hyperparameter tuning.

## ðŸ’¼ Business Context

Emotion classification in text has various business applications, such as:

- Customer opinion mining (e.g., product or service reviews)
- Monitoring public mood on social media
- Detecting potential PR crises
- Enhancing chatbot responses through emotion-aware dialog

By identifying user emotions accurately, companies can make better decisions, improve customer experience, and build stronger user relationships.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

- **Name**: *Emotions Dataset*
- **Source**: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datasets/emotions)
- **Size**: ~400,000 records  
- **Columns**: `id`, `text`, `label` (emotion)
- **Classes**:  
  - `0` - sadness  
  - `1` - joy  
  - `2` - love  
  - `3` - anger  
  - `4` - fear  
  - `5` - surprise  
- No missing values  
- Labels are imbalanced (sadness and joy are dominant)

## ðŸ§¹ Data Preparation

- Text cleaning & tokenization  
- Label encoding  
- Exploratory analysis (e.g., class distribution, text length stats)  
- Median input length: **17 words**

## ðŸ§  Model Architecture

The core model is a **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** network:

- Embedding layer  
- LSTM layer  
- Dropout for regularization  
- Dense output layer with softmax activation  

## ðŸ§ª Modeling Strategy

Five model variants were trained and compared:

- **Model 1**: baseline LSTM  
- **Model 2-3**: tuned dropout and epochs  
- **Model 4-5**: increased input sequence length to 40 tokens

## âœ… Key Results

- Final accuracy: **~93%**  
- Best performing: **Model 4** (longer input context)  
- Main improvements came from increasing input length, not from dropout or epoch count  
- Significant boost in F1-score for minority emotion classes  
- Confusion matrix showed drastic error reduction in ambiguous or underrepresented emotions

> ðŸ’¡ Longer input sequences helped the model better understand the semantic context of each text.

## ðŸ§° Tools & Technologies

- Python  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- NumPy, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, scikit-learn
